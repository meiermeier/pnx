# PoshelNahiuException

## What is PoshelNahiuException?

The **PoshelNahiuException** is a revolutionary approach to exception handling that acknowledges the existence of those rare, galaxy-brained individuals who manage to uncover the most improbable bugs or corner cases in your code. 

This isn't your average `NullPointerException` or `IndexOutOfBoundsError`. Oh no, this is for those times when your brain simply screams, **"Poshel Nahiu!"** (a.k.a. "Get lost, please and kindly!").

This exception is especially useful in environments where you're completely done, the coffee machine is broken, and you suspect QA might secretly work for the opposition. Deploy it with confidence when resolving the issue is beyond mortal comprehension, and your energy reserves are lower than the company's budget for proper testing.

## When to Use It?

Use the **PoshelNahiuException** in the following scenarios:

- **Your code works on your machine, but nowhere else.**  
  _"It compiled yesterday, I swear."_

- **QA discovers something that shouldn't even be physically possible.**  
  _"What do you mean the database caught fire?!"_

- **You're too tired to even Google the error message.**  
  _"Let the future me or someone else figure this out."_

- **To passively-aggressively tell QA or your future self to buzz off.**  
  _"If you understand this bug, congratulations. You're now the maintainer."_

- **When management demands a hotfix, but you know better.**  
  _"Oh, you want this fixed in five minutes? Sure, let me throw one of these bad boys in."_
